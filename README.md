### 🕵️‍♂️ Software Quality Assurance Persona
As a QA Engineer, I act as the final gatekeeper of quality. My mission is to ensure that every release is stable, scalable, and user-friendly.

* **Manual Exploratory Testing:** Navigating through applications like an end-user to find edge-case bugs that automation might miss.
* **Test Automation:** Crafting robust scripts using **Selenium** and **Playwright** to handle repetitive regression suites.
* **API Validation:** Ensuring seamless communication between services using **Postman** and **Rest-Assured**.
* **Performance Testing:** Stress-testing systems with **JMeter** to ensure they don't buckle under pressure.
* **Defect Management:** Transforming chaotic bugs into organized, actionable tickets on **Trello** and **Jira**.



> *"A developer's job is to build the dream; my job is to make sure it doesn't turn into a production nightmare."*
